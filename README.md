# Technical_documents
Some documents I wrote about technologies that I used to work in IT.

Since 1997 I have been working in the IT area. I had the opportunity to use many different technologies in different projects. Due to some complex issues I was dealing with, I decide to record my acquired knowledge in documents, so that if I forget something used in the past, I can review it and have useful things back to mind.
